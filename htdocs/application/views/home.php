                Hello wonderful people!<br/><br/>
                First of all, I want to thank you guys so much for your help this summer. This website CANNOT be completed without your guys' help!<br/>
                Second, this will be our development site for now. We will upload all our work here so we can all see it!<br/>
                I look forward to working with each and every one of you!
                Stephen<br/><br/>
                And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus<br/>
                Philippians 4:7
