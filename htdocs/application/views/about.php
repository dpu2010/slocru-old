            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">
                SLO Cru and CRU Central Coast are a part of
                <a href="http://www.cru.org/">Cru</a>
                (formerly <i>Campus Crusade for Christ Int'l.</i>), an
                interdenominational, worldwide Christian ministry with the goal
                of giving every student the opportunity to hear and respond to
                the Good News of Jesus Christ.
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">
                With over a thousand students involved in our ministry, we have
                dozens of opportunities to make lifelong friends and share Jesus
                through Community Group Bible studies, social events,
                Discipleship relationships, short-term missions, and weekly
                large group meetings.

                various speakers, including our staff and local campus director,
