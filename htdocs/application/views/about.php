            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">
                SLO Cru and CRU Central Coast are a part of
                <a href="http://www.cru.org/">Cru</a>
                (formerly <i>Campus Crusade for Christ Int'l.</i>), an
                interdenominational, worldwide Christian ministry with the goal
                of giving every student the opportunity to hear and respond to
                the Good News of Jesus Christ.
            </p>
            <p class="text-dark">
                With over a thousand students involved in our ministry, we have
                dozens of opportunities to make lifelong friends and share Jesus
                through Community Group Bible studies, social events,
                Discipleship relationships, short-term missions, and weekly
                large group meetings.

                residence at Cal Poly, as well as in several locations
                throughout the greater SLO area.

                various speakers, including our staff and local campus director,
                Jamey Pappas. There are
